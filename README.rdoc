Parrainage is a rails 4 App for managing people in a way specific to my engineering school union.

It can list a first group of people to learn their names, and allows a second group of people to be registred for events and vote for people from the first group. Weird hum?

It ran on a t2.micro in production for a year for 150 users. It crashed on the first votenight.
